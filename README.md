# Memory

Since you built a game of memory during the fundamentals, you should be familiar with the way the game is played. This version of memory has been modified so that instead of matching two cards with the same graphic, the player matches a picture of the card with text describing the card.

This is the first game in JavaScript that I got to work. I started at the end of October 2014 and finished this version in February 2015, so it took me 3 months to get this far. If you find instances where the code is DRY, it is a happy accident. We're going to fix that.

## Instructions

- Fork this repository and then clone to your local computer.
- Review the code that is in the file and see how it works. Playing the game a few times with the developer tools open might be helpful. Set breakpoints where you don't understand how the code works and watch it in the developer tools.
- Work on one change at a time. Commit to git every time you get a change working before you move on to the next change.
- Find instances where you can make the code DRYer, and go for it.

## How to Win

The winner is the person who can refactor the code to make it:
  - more readable
  - maintainable
  - reduce repetition

You must do this without losing functionality.
