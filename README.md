# Memory

Since you built a game of memory during the fundamentals, you should be familiar with the way the game is played. This version of memory has been modified so that instead of matching two cards with the same graphic, the player matches a picture of the card with text describing the card.

This is the first game in JavaScript that I got to work. I started at the end of October 2014 and finished this version in February 2015, so it took me 3 months to get this far. If you find instances where the code is DRY, it is a happy accident. We're going to fix that.

## Instructions

- Fork this repository so that you can work on your own copy.
- Review the code that is in the file and see how it works. Playing the game a few times with the developer tools open might be helpful.
- Find instances where you can make the code DRYer, and go for it.
